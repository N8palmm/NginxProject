## Project Details

- **Developer:** Gabriel Nathaniel
- **Final Project for:** McDns LLC
- **Bootcamp Program:** MCDNS LLC
- **GitHub Repository:** [https://github.com/N8palmm/docker-final]

## Project Objectives

The primary objectives of the project include:

- Creating a custom Docker Image with Nginx.
- Serving a static HTML page with personalized content.
- Ensuring the Docker image is easily deployable in various environments.

This makes it an ideal solution for teams looking to showcase their projects or ideas.

## Docker Image Build

A Dockerfile defines the custom Nginx Image, incorporating the HTML content.

## Testing and Verification

Local testing ensures the correctness of the custom HTML content and overall application functionality.

## Technological Stack
